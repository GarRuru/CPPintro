But Dagon’s Temple, and the finest Structures of Tyre and Sidon, could not be compared with the Eternal God’s Temple at Jerusalem, begun and finish’d, to the Amazement of all the World, in the short space of Seven Years and Six Months, by that wisest Man and most glorious King of Israel, the Prince of Peace and Architecture, Solomon (the Son of David, who was refused that Honour for being a Man of Blood) by divine Direction, without the noise of Work-mens Tools, though there were employ’d about it no less than 3,600 Princes, or Master-Masons, to conduct the Work according to Salomon’s directions, with 80,000 Hewers of Stone in the Mountain, or Fellow Craftsmen, and 70,000 Labourers, in all 153,600 besides the Levy under Adoniram to work in the Mountains of Lebanon by turns with the Sidonians, viz. 30,000 being in all 183,600 for which great Number of ingenious Masons, Solomon was much oblig’d to Hiram, or Huram, King of Tyre, who sent his Masons and Carpenters to Jerusalem, and the Firs and Cedars of Lebanon to Joppa, the next Sea-port. But above all, he sent his Namesake Hiram, or Huram, the most accomplish’d Mason upon Earth.
